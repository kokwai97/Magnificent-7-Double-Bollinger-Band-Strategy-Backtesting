This is an iterative backtester to simulate trading based on signals generated by the Double Bollinger Bands strategy for the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. The following performance metrics are computed to assess the effectiveness of the trading strategy:

1. Final Capital Balance
2. Total Return
3. Annual Return
4. Annual Volatility
5. Sharpe Ratio
6. Sortino Ratio
7. Maximum Drawdown

Generally, Magnificent 7 & Double Bollinger Band Strategy Backtesting.ipynb requires 3 libraries to be run: 
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. YFinance

The code consists of several functions for modularity and a for-loop to loop through each of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks.
1. buy.py - Buys shares
2. sell.py - Sells shares
3. execute_trade.py - Executes trades based on trading signals generated
4. total_and_annual_returns.py - Compute the total and annual returns
5. annual_volatility.py - Compute the annual volatility
6. sharpe_ratio.py - Computes the Sharpe ratio
7. sortino_ratio.py - Computes the Sortino ratio
8. max_drawdown.py - Computes the maximum drawdown
9. backtester.py - An iterative backtester which first computes the Double Bollinger bands and then simulates tradings based on signals generated using the bands
10. mag_7_for_loop.py - A for-loop to loop through each of the 'Magnificent 7' stocks
